DESCRIPTION
  LinFreeze is a script you can use to "freeze" a user's home directory or any other directory so that file changes are not permanent.
It does this by layering a tmpfs layer on top of the user's home folder (or the directory of your choosing), where all changes will be stored.
Optionally, you may use a "static" directory to be layered on top of the directory containing temporary, read-only files and folders.
